title: LowestScoreDrop
text: |
  Write a program that calculates the average of a group of test scores, 
  where the lowest score in the group is dropped. 
  It should use the following functions...

  -getScores() should first ask the user for a list of 5 test scores to be entered.
  -findLowest() should find and return the lowest of the 5 scores passed to it.
  -calcAverage() should calculate and display the average of the highest 4 scores.

  Input Validation = Should not accept test scores lower than 0 or higher than 100.
  
  Refer to example below.
  
  lowestScoreDrop() = 
  lowestScoreDrop() = 
code: |
  function lowestScoreDrop(num) {
    return num;
  }

  assert(lowestScoreDrop(0) === 0);
  assert(lowestScoreDrop(123) === 6);
  assert(lowestScoreDrop(456) === 15);
  assert(lowestScoreDrop(789) === 24);
  assert(lowestScoreDrop(-123) === 4);
  assert(lowestScoreDrop(-456) === 7);
  alert('Passed all test cases!');
tests:
  - assert(lowestScoreDrop(0) === 0);
  - assert(lowestScoreDrop(123) === 6);
  - assert(lowestScoreDrop(456) === 15);
  - assert(lowestScoreDrop(789) === 24);
  - assert(lowestScoreDrop(-123) === 4);
  - assert(lowestScoreDrop(-456) === 7);
