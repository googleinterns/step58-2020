      <p>Yellow Brick Code is a web app that aims to teach coders to write healthy and maintainable
      code. Improve your skills by solving coding problems, understanding the complexity of your solution,
      and seeing how other people approached the same problem.</p>
      <p>Our goal is to enable anyone to learn how to write readable code like a software engineer, to
      empower coders to get rid of the bad habits that come with learning how to code, and to prevent
      the start of bad habits. This platform is designed for programmers who know the basics of coding, but 
      want to practice writing cleaner code.</p>
